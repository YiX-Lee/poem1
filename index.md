# If by life you were deceived

## If by life you were deceived.

## Don't be dismal, dont be wild.

## In the day of grief, be mild.

## Marry days will come, believe.

## Heart is living in tomorrow.

## Present is dejected here.

## In a moment, passes sorrow.

## That which passed will be dear.
